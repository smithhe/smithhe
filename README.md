## 🏡 Homelab

I maintain a homelab of Linux servers where I experiment with new technologies and work on various projects. Some key projects and tools I use in my homelab include:

- **TrueNAS**: For managing and storing data securely.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration of services.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For tracking, logging, and visualizing server performance and application metrics.
- **Self-hosted services**: Hosting personal applications and testing deployment strategies.

Working with my homelab allows me to explore areas such as server management, virtualization, and networking, and it gives me practical experience to apply in my professional projects.
